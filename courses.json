Discussion covers issues related to technology as a vehicle for collecting, storing, and sharing data and information, including privacy, ethics, security, and social impact. Applied exercises focus on the manipulation, analysis, and visualization of data and effective data communication strategies. Students may receive credit for only one of the following courses: BMGT 301, CAPP 101, CAPP 300, CMST 300, IFSM 201, or TMGT 201.\n",
